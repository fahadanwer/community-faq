# KodeKloud Community Guidelines

1. **Embrace Respectful Interaction**: Please approach all members with kindness, respect, and consideration. Let's steer clear of offensive or discriminatory language and behavior.

1. **Champion Patience**: Acknowledge that not everyone may share the same level of expertise. Let's be patient and understanding when addressing questions or providing assistance. This fosters a supportive and inclusive community environment.

1. **Mindful of Redundancy**: To maintain clarity and prevent confusion, we kindly ask that you refrain from posting the same message in multiple channels.

1. **Explore Before Inquiring**: Prior to posting a message, we recommend utilizing [Discord's](https://discord.gg/neZ7jwZ2CP) for interacting with real-time KodeKloud updates and [Forum](https://kodekloud.com/community/) to explore existing discussions and resources. 

1. **Encourage Open Discussions**: We encourage members to initiate discussions publicly in the relevant forum category. While Discord can be useful for sensitive matters, please refrain from DMing unless absolutely necessary. Engaging in open discussions fosters collective learning and knowledge sharing efficiency.

# For Discord

1. **A Pause on Promotions**: We'd like to gently remind everyone that promotional or advertising content is not in line with our KodeKloud community ethos. Please use the designated channels, such as `#random`, for such communications in Discord Server.

1. **Introduction and Greetings Protocol**: For initial greetings and introductions, we encourage you to utilize the `#say-hi` channel. This ensures that other channels remain focused on their intended topics.

1. **Considerate Use of Technical Channels on Discord**: Channels like `#aws-courses`, `#cka-discussions`, and similar ones are strictly for technical discussions in Discord. Please use channels like `#say-hi` for greetings and casual conversations. This keeps discussions in the right context.

1. **Channel Description Awareness**: Before posting, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the purpose and guidelines outlined in each channel's description. This ensures that your message is aligned with the channel's intended focus and contributes to a more organized and relevant discussion.

1. **File and Link Sharing Etiquette**: When sharing files or links, please provide context and briefly explain their relevance to the discussion. This helps members understand the content without having to open the file or link.

1. **Exam Integrity and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**: KodeKloud strictly prohibits the use or sharing of exam dumps, asking about or publishing details of any question encountered in an exam, as these activitites violate the NDA and can lead to disqualification from exams. Upholding community integrity is paramount. Refraining from such activities is essential, and non-compliance may result in a ban.



# Seeking Technical Guidance? Use Community Forum

1. **Where to Post**: Please use our [Discourse forum](https://community.kodekloud.com/) to post technical queries.

1. **Utilize Designated Catergories in Community Forum**: KodeKloud community offers specific categories tailored to various topics. For instance, [AZURE](https://kodekloud.com/community/c/cloud/azure-courses/31) is dedicated to Azure queries. Please find the category that best matches your query.

1. **Comprehensive Queries for Effective Communication**: When asking questions, strive to incorporate all relevant details into one cohesive message. Additionally, consider utilizing threads to keep the conversation organized. This practice enhances clarity and preserves context, contributing to more productive discussions.


    In forums, please pay special attention to how to format `code` emphasis and

    ```
    code blocks
    ```

    Use of code blocks is essential when pasting program code or YAML. Without this they will be formatted as text, possibly also rendering some strings of punctuation as emojis, losing important indentation and we cannot do a syntax check.

    Please also refrain from pasting screen shots of code that you want others to verify - again, this is what code blocks are for.

1. **Stuck with Labs**: Please, when raising queries about questions in labs, include a link to the lab you are stuck on. This helps the support staff find the lab quickly and therefore more able to assist promptly. For Ultimate Mock labs where the questions are randomized, please include the `section` and the first couple of lines of the question. A screen shot including these things is acceptable here.

These guidelines are in place to ensure that our KodeKloud community remains a positive and enriching environment for all. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated. Thank you!
